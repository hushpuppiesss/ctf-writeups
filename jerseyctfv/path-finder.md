## description
The map with some weird objects stored on a USB flash drive was revealed in one of the New York City's sewage systems...Who left it there? Does it relate to a recent crime on one of NY streets? Or it might be even worse...it was carried through a sewage for miles. Anyway, this is your turn to discover the hidden message.
